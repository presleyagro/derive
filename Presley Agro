## Site 1
* https://bizzybizzycreative.com
* i googled creative and busy websites and choose the first link.
* the design is extremely curent and trendy. Very natural, earth atmosphere setting. The nuetral, greens, purples, and teals make it appear that way.
* The navigation system is very familiar and easy to use. Many drop down menus and circle buttons. Enough information but not too much. 
* The website lets you make and design your own brand or website so after navigating to your decision the rest is interactive and up to you. 
* I do believe the site is useful, extremely intersting and very very good looking. The design is simple but makes an impact, especially if you like the style of the website. 
* One thing i would change would be the font for the drop down menus on the homepage. The font is difficult to read and looks very messy.

## Site 2
* http://www.creativitypost.com
* i typed in a random word in the search bar and went to the first option.
* This webiste looks like it has a virus. The design is not current or trendy, it looks like a TMZ news page. Unorganized, terrible type.
* Even though everything you would need to find is on the front page, its all displayed and the layout is very unogranized and messy.
* The only interactive part about this webiste is being able to join a debate on the site, it does not display what the debate is about.
* The site does have a lot of useful, creative and interesting information to read. It could be useful to some people, depending on what your searching for. Very interesting. Not at all beautiful. 
* There are very many things i would change about this website. But the most important thing i would change would be the layout. There are paragraphs of random information everywhere, with a small picture for each one. It looks unorganzied and messy. It's diffuclt to follow the flow of information.

## Site 3
* http://selflessportraits.com
* I found this webiste off of the pervious site.
* There is not really anywhere to navigate to form the homepage other then looking at the portraits on another page, contacting the person who made the site, and being able to share things on twitter and facebook.
*  It is very simply laid out and the design is modern and clean.
* The site does not really have any interactive features other then being able to share things on facebook and twitter.
* I like the site a lot for the purpose of what its about. The website lets people upload their facebook profile pictures and other people around the world draw them.
* There is not much i would change about the site only because there is not a lot to change. It has a homepage with a slideshow of pictures, then another page of all the drawings, then a contact page and an order page if you want to purchase one or send a selfie in. It is very simply laid out and all the information is present.

## Site 4
* https://coffitivity.com
* I found this webiste by googling creative music webistes.
* This site is a little out dated, but still current and trendy depending on your style. What makes it appear this way to me would be the childish colour scheme. The concept of the website is very common and a lot of people could benefit from a website like this.
* Navigating through the webiste is very simply, there are tabs on the top of the screen, all information in that tab diplays on the same page as the homepage and the rest of them. It's extremely easy to go through, the layout could be a little more organized.
* The webiste allows you to choose "coffee house playlists" to listen to, different generes of music for being at work or studying. There is also a "Research" part of the website where you could do a little experiement to see if music really helps you study.
* I like the webiste a lot. It could be very useful to anyone who likes to listen to music or podcasts while they work or just for doing anything. The website is visually appealing but seems unorganized to me.
* One thing i would change about the webiste wouold be having cleaner, more open looking layouts for each page.

## Site 5
* https://activetheory.net/work
* I found this webiste through the pervious with suggestions.
* This is the coolest website i have ever been on. The homepage is interactive right away just by hovering your mous over the page. Every part of the webiste looks interesting and mysterious because of the artwork and colours used. 
* The navigation system is a little confusing only because of the style of the webiste, the navigation buttons are a little small. But the layout is very current and advanced, it looks almost furturistic.
* Every part of the site is interactive. This webiste takes you on serveral interactive adventours, from going through all of Hogwarts to particiapting in a challenge where you are in a simulation as an airforce piolt. There are many different generes of almost virtual reality.
* This website is more about experiences then being useful. It's a kind of site you look at if you are looking for inspiration or your just bored. It's very interesting, ive never really come accross a website like this.
* One thing i would change about the website might be the organization part of the site. Everything is kind of all over the place but still accesible.
